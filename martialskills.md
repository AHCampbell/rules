_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Unarmed Combat</span>_

	This skill allows the character to use two Short Weapon length boffer weapons to represent claws or fists in order to fight in melee combat. The character may block with their Unarmed Combat weapons without taking damage normally.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Short Weapon</span>_

The character may use a short one hand weapon between 24” long and less than 36” long in melee combat. Short one hand weapons include short sword, short axe, short hammer, and short club. This skill allows the use of the weapon in either hand, but not the ability to wield a short weapon in both hands at once.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Long Weapon</span>_

The character may use a long one hand weapon between 36” long and less than 48” long in melee combat. Long one hand weapons include long sword, rapier, battleaxe, warhammer, warmace, spear, and club.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Two Hand Weapon</span>_

The character may use a two hand weapon between 48” long and 72” long in melee combat. Two hand weapons include two hand swords, polearms, staves, and two hand clubs. Two hand weapons require both hands to be on the weapon in order to attack or block in melee combat. If the character blocks an attack with only one hand, the character will take the damage as if they had not blocked the attack at all.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ranged Weapon</span>_

This skill allows the character to use a ranged weapon in combat. Ranged weapons include bow, crossbow, and throwing weapons. Ranged weapons cannot be used to block attacks.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Shield</span>_

This skill allows the character to wield a shield used to block attacks. A shield may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character has either hand on a shield, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the shield is considered effectively blocked.  The maximum surface area of a shield is 531 square inches. The longest dimension a shield may have is 36”.  Shields may not be used with two hand weapons, bows, or crossbows. A character may not dual wield shields.

<h2 id="physical-strikes">**Physical Strikes**</h2>


**	**Physical strikes are weapon delivered combat effects used by characters. A physical strike is delivered once using a weapon attack, and must strike the target character successfully without being blocked in order to be a successful attack. Physical strikes are considered used whether the attack was successful or not. Physical strikes that are blocked by shields or weapons, have been blocked and are considered unsuccessful attacks. Unsuccessful physical strikes and physical strikes that have been resisted can be regained by the character resting. Physical strike effects are not magical in nature; therefore, they cannot be removed by the Dispel Magic spell or any removal skill that is limited to effects of magical origin only.

<h2>Damage Calls & Carriers</h2>


Damage calls are how you communicate the amount of damage being delivered, as well as its type and whether or not it has a flavor modifier or carrier.  You may only use one value for each option.

Examples:



* 5 Normal
* 2 Magic Flame
* 23 Silver Death

Suppose you have a normal longsword, a transform with the Magic Aura and Flame Aura abilities, and a Frost coating applied to the weapon. You would swing one of:



* 5 Magic
* 5 Normal
* 5 Magic Flame
* 5 Normal Flame
* 5 Magic Frost
* 5 Normal Frost

<h2>Spellstrike</h2>


Spellstrikes are spells cast upon a target via a physically represented weapon.  Packets do not count, as this would be touch casting.  Spellstrikes may not be refused in the way touch casts can.  Defenses for spells such as Spell Mirror, Intercept, and Parry Spell are effective against Spellstrikes.  The Parry skill will not block the spell of a Spellstrike.  If you physically parry a Spellstrike, you take the effect of the spell.
